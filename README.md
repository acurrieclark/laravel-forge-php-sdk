# Laravel Forge PHP SDK
An Unofficial PHP SDK for Laravel Forge API
Taylor Otwell has graciously given us a REST API for Laravel Forge. This simple
PHP SDK is a wrapper around that API to be used in your PHP projects

# Get A Key
The first thing you need to do before starting a project is register for an API token
at https://forge.laravel.com/user/profile#/api

#Download Project
composer require mastashake08/laravel-forge-php-sdk
